    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>

    <p>Hey there! This is my basic webpage where I'm trying out HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
       It's a part of my learning process to understand how websites are actually built and styled.</p>

    <p>First up, HTML helps in setting up the structure.
        So I’ve used headings, paragraphs, images, and a button here just to get the hang of it.</p>
    
    <p>If you click on the Apex planet you are redirected to another website.</p>

    <p>Then with CSS, I styled everything a bit — gave it colors, fonts, and spacing so it looks a bit neat and clean, not just raw code.</p>

    <p>Finally, I added some JavaScript just to see how interaction works.
        You’ll see an alert message when you click the button below. Nothing fancy, just basic interactivity.</p>

    <p>This is just the start. Planning to build better and more functional pages soon.</p>

    <button onclick="showAlert()">Click Me</button>

    <script>
        function showAlert() {
            alert("You clicked the button! This shows basic JavaScript interactivity.");
        }
    </script>
</body>
